## Codebase Patterns

- OpenAI passthrough responses for Modal/OpenHands/OhMyGPT are handled in goproxy/internal/maintarget/handler.go.
- Troll OpenAI stream path already rewrites chunk model via eventData["model"] = modelID.
- Anthropic and Troll transformer response paths already set model from transformer input.

## 2026-02-13 Task backend-1

- Status: completed
- Commit: pending
- Changes:
  - Added `modelID string` parameter to `HandleOpenAIStreamResponse` and `HandleOpenAINonStreamResponse` in `goproxy/internal/maintarget/handler.go`.
  - Updated current call sites in `goproxy/main.go` to pass placeholder model value (`""`) for compilation before task 4 wiring.
- Verification:
  - `go build ./...` passed
  - `go vet ./...` passed

## 2026-02-13 Task backend-2

- Status: completed
- Commit: pending
- Changes:
  - Added SSE chunk `model` field rewriting in `goproxy/internal/maintarget/handler.go` for `data:` lines with valid JSON payload.
  - Preserved graceful fallback behavior: if JSON parsing/marshalling fails, original stream line is forwarded unchanged.
- Verification:
  - `go build ./...` passed
  - `go test ./internal/maintarget/...` passed (`[no test files]`)

## 2026-02-13 Task backend-3

- Status: completed
- Commit: pending
- Changes:
  - Added non-stream OpenAI response model rewriting in `goproxy/internal/maintarget/handler.go`.
  - Preserved graceful fallback: if response JSON cannot be parsed/marshalled, original body is returned unchanged.
- Verification:
  - `go build ./...` passed
  - `go test ./internal/maintarget/...` passed (`[no test files]`)
