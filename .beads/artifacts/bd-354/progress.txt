# Progress Log

Bead: bd-354
Started: 2026-02-14

## Codebase Patterns

- OpenHands response routing in `goproxy/main.go` delegates stream/non-stream behavior to maintarget handlers.
- Anthropic response transformations are implemented in `goproxy/internal/maintarget/handler.go` and validated in `goproxy/internal/maintarget/handler_test.go`.
