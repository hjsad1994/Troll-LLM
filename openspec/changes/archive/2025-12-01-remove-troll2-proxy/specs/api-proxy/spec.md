## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Troll-2 Streaming Usage Tracking

**Reason**: Troll-2 proxy (MegaLLM upstream) is being completely removed from the project.

**Migration**: Models previously using Troll-2 upstream are no longer available. Users should use models with `main` or `troll` upstream instead.
